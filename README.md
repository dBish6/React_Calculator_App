# React_Calculator_App
This repository contains two versions of a simple calculator app built with ReactJS: `react_calculator_reducer` and `react_calculator_states`.

## react_calculator_reducer
This version of the calculator app uses the `useReducer` hook from React to manage the state of the application. By using a reducer function to handle state updates based on different actions, this approach can make it easier to manage many state changes.

## react_calculator_states
This version of the calculator app uses the `useState` hook from React to manage the state of the application. While this approach can work well for simpler applications, the react_calculator_states version was not fully finished because I found that useReducer was a more appropriate tool for handling multiple actions and complex state changes.
